🎓 PlacementOracle AI
Student Placement Prediction & Insight System
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

📌 Project Overview:

PlacementOracle AI is an end-to-end, explainable machine learning system designed to predict whether a student is likely to get placed based on academic performance, employability factors, and prior experience.
The project focuses on understanding, interpretability, and real-world placement scenarios, rather than black-box predictions.

This system helps students and educators gain insights into the key factors influencing placement outcomes.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

🎯 Objectives:

Predict student placement status (Placed / Not Placed)

Estimate placement probability for new students

Compare multiple machine learning models

Explain which factors influence placement decisions

Provide an interactive, user-friendly dashboard
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

🧠 Machine Learning Workflow:

Data Loading & Exploration

Understand dataset structure

Analyze missing values and class distribution

Data Preprocessing

Handle missing values

Encode categorical features

Scale numerical features

Model Training

Logistic Regression

Decision Tree

Random Forest

Model Evaluation

Accuracy

Precision, Recall, F1-Score

Confusion Matrix

Explainability

Feature importance visualization using Random Forest

Prediction

Predict placement status and probability for new students

Deployment

Interactive Streamlit dashboard
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

📊 Dataset:

Dataset Name: Campus Placement Dataset

Source: Kaggle

Format: CSV

Target Variable: status (Placed / Not Placed)

The dataset includes academic scores, work experience, specialization, and employability test performance of students.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

🛠️ Tech Stack:

Programming Language: Python

Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn

Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn

Web Framework: Streamlit

Version Control: Git & GitHub
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

📈 Key Insights:

Academic performance and employability test scores strongly influence placement

Work experience significantly improves placement probability

Ensemble models like Random Forest provide better accuracy and explainability
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

📌 Limitations & Future Improvements:

Dataset does not include entry path (Diploma / Intermediate)

Predictions are probability-based, not guarantees

Future enhancements may include:

SHAP-based explainability

Support for multiple degree programs

Skill-based feature integration
